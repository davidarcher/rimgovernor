    /// WANTED 15, in M's words: *"An external file where the shape/location
    /// of a room is recorded, along with its name. When a room is checked (or a
    /// coordinate is sent out with the intent of checking the room it covers), I'd
    /// like it to reply with the room name, location w/coordinates, pawns in it,
    /// furniture/buildings in it, and the names of any stockpiles in it."*
    ///
    /// ## Why there is no external key file
    ///
    /// A room in RimWorld has no player-given name and no stable identity. `Room.ID`
    /// is handed out by a static counter and a room is DESTROYED and remade every
    /// time a wall changes — `RegionAndRoomUpdater` rebuilds them, so knocking one
    /// hole in a wall renumbers both rooms involved. A hand-maintained key file
    /// would therefore be a file of stale ids pointing at rooms that no longer
    /// exist, and reading it would be worse than having nothing, because it would
    /// look authoritative.
    ///
    /// What the game DOES have is a name it computes itself: `Room.Role` (a
    /// `RoomRoleDef` chosen by scoring every role worker against the room's
    /// contents) plus the owners of any bed inside it. That is `name` below —
    /// "Bedroom (Lucas)" — recomputed fresh on every call, so it is never stale.
    /// The key characters a caller paints a map with are a RESPONSE-LOCAL index,
    /// for the same reason: they mean something for one reply and nothing after it.
    ///
    /// ## No rect cap
    ///
    /// `home/get_temperatures` walks a rectangle and is capped at 16,384 cells,
    /// so covering a 250x250 map with it takes ~7 calls and ~260 KB. This tool
    /// does not walk cells to FIND rooms; it reads `RegionGrid.AllRooms`, which is
    /// a public `IReadOnlyList&lt;Room&gt;` the game maintains anyway. Whole map,
    /// one property access, no cap.
    ///
    /// The cells ARE walked, once, per LISTED room — for `center`, for the
    /// stockpile intersection and for the optional `cells[]`. That is why the
    /// outdoors mega-room is off by default: on Lampblack it is 49,347 cells, and

    /// ## Four hazards the decompile turned up, and what is done about each
    ///
    ///   1. **`Room.ContainedAndAdjacentThings` returns a CACHED buffer.** The
    ///      getter clears one HashSet and one List on the room and refills them, so
    ///      the next read of the property invalidates the list you were handed. It
    ///      is therefore COPIED into a local list the instant it is read, and every
    ///      later question (beds, contents, boundary) is asked of the copy. Note
    ///      that `Room.ContainedBeds` and `Room.Owners` both re-read the property
    ///      lazily while yielding, which is exactly the interleave that would bite;
    ///      `Owners` is read to completion before any other read, and the beds come
    ///      off the local copy rather than out of `ContainedBeds`.
    ///   2. **`Room.Regions` returns a cached `tmpRegions` list on the room.**
    ///      `ExtentsClose` and `ContainedAndAdjacentThings` both consume it fully
    ///      before returning, so they are safe one at a time — but nothing here may
    ///      hold an `ExtentsClose` enumerator open across another read, and nothing
    ///      does.
    ///   3. **`Zone.Cells` (capital C) SHUFFLES the zone's cell list in place.**
    ///      `home/list_zones` records that too. This tool never touches it: the
    ///      stockpile answer comes from `ZoneManager.ZoneAt(cell)` walking the
    ///      LISTED ROOM's cells, which is the authoritative zone grid rather than
    ///      the zone's own list, and the two are known to disagree.
    ///   4. **`Room.Role`, `GetRoomRoleLabel()` and `GetStat()` fill a lazy
    ///      cache.** All three call `UpdateRoomStatsAndRole()` when
    ///      `statsAndRoleDirty`, which writes `stats` and `role` on the room. That
    ///      is the game's own memoisation — the same thing that happens the moment
    ///      the player's cursor enters the room — not a change to the colony, and
    ///      `home/get_temperatures` has read `Role` since it was written. Nothing
    ///      here calls `Notify_RoomShapeChanged` (which DOES mutate: it invokes
    ///      `autoBuildRoofAreaSetter.TryGenerateAreaFor`) or any setter.
    ///
    /// ## What comes back null, and what is omitted
    ///
    /// A read that throws becomes `null` on the row and its name is added to that
    /// room's `skipped[]`, so "the getter failed" is never dressed as "there is
    /// none". A room whose whole row could not be built still appears, with
    /// `skipped` naming what went wrong. Rooms that are not listed at all are
    /// COUNTED in the summary (`roomsOmitted`, `outdoorRoomsOmitted`,
    /// `doorwaysOmitted`, `dereferencedRoomsOmitted`) and, for the big ones,
    /// named in `omitted[]` — a filter that does not state itself is the failure
    /// this whole companion is written against.
