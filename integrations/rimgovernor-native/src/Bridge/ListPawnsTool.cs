    /// <summary>
    /// home/list_pawns — every spawned pawn on the current map, with the one
    /// fact the whole play stack could not read without clicking: whether it is
    /// HOSTILE.
    ///
    /// ## Why this exists (M, 2026-08-31)
    ///
    /// The threat sweep and the Lookout's creature check were both answering
    /// "is there something dangerous near us?" by pulling every CELL in a
    /// 61x61 box around each colonist and looking at what was standing on it:
    /// 3,721 cells per colonist, 8 bridge calls, 1.7 MB of terrain, roofs,
    /// designations and zone ids, to find at most a handful of pawns. M,
    /// on being shown the number:
    ///
    ///     "oh okay well goddamn it's that high on 30? what the heck are we
    ///      doing to check??? it should just be 'pawns within these
    ///      coordinates, are you hostile (red nametag)' is it that long?"
    ///     "i figured the list of pawns in the game wouldn't be that long to
    ///      run through"
    ///     "are we doing an area search tile by tile or smth?"
    ///
    /// Yes, tile by tile, and she is right that it is absurd. RimWorld already
    /// keeps the list: `map.mapPawns.AllPawnsSpawned`. Reading it is O(pawns),
    /// not O(cells), and the answer is a few KB instead of megabytes.
    ///
    /// The bridge could not do this before: of its 127 tools the only pawn
    /// lister is `rimworld/list_colonists`, which is documented
    /// player-controlled-colonists-only and has no parameter that widens it. So
    /// allegiance had to come from `click_cell`, and a click is a mutation —
    /// which is why the read-only Lookout check could only ever say "the game
    /// raised no alert", never "that animal is not hostile".
    ///
    /// ## What "hostile" means here, exactly
    ///
    /// Two independent things put a red nametag over a pawn, and reporting only
    /// the first would be the same class of silent gap this companion exists to
    /// close:
    ///
    ///   * `faction.HostileTo(Faction.OfPlayer)` — raiders, hostile tribes,
    ///     mechanoids.
    ///   * a manhunter MENTAL STATE — a manhunter pack is ordinary wildlife
    ///     with no faction at all. Faction alone would report a pack of
    ///     enraged boars as neutral.
    ///
    /// `hostile` is true for either, and `hostileReason` says which, so a
    /// caller is never guessing why. Both are always present, never omitted.
    ///
    /// A predator that has not yet begun hunting is genuinely NOT hostile by
    /// either test, and that is the honest answer rather than a limitation:
    /// `job` carries what it is actually doing, so a caller can see
    /// `PredatorHunt` and decide for itself.
    ///
    /// ## health / needs -- added 2026-09-01 (M, on camera, twice)
    ///
    ///     "sometimes I seen hands rapidly flip through all the colonist's
    ///      health tabs. does the thing that gives the list of pawns not have an
    ///      option for that? if not make a note of it please"
    ///
    /// It did not. `health.py` answered "what is wrong with everyone" by, per
    /// colonist, clearing the selection, selecting the pawn, listing the inspect
    /// tabs, opening the Health tab and regexing a full-screen `get_ui_layout`
    /// dump -- five bridge calls and two visible UI mutations EACH, which is
    /// exactly the tab-flipping she watched happen on stream. The stock bridge
    /// had no other door: a repo-wide grep of the upstream server for
    /// `hediffSet`, `needs.`, `mood` returns nothing, and `open_inspect_tab`
    /// never calls the tab's `FillTab` or reads anything off its subject.
    ///
    /// So these are OPT-IN parameters on the pawn list rather than a separate
    /// tool, deliberately: the reason a fork went to the UI is that it reached
    /// for the pawn list, found no health column, and left. A separate tool
    /// reproduces the gap.
    ///
    /// `health: true` adds a `health` block per pawn; `needs: true` adds a
    /// `needs` block. Both are off by default so the ordinary threat sweep --
    /// the call `watch.py` makes every step -- does not grow.
    ///
    /// **No watch list, ever.** Every hediff is returned; the caller filters.
    /// `health.py` used to carry a curated tuple of 13 condition names and it
    /// silently dropped "Food poisoning" while a colonist had it. A reader that
    /// drops the category the answer is in, and says nothing, is worse than no
    /// reader.
    ///
    /// ### Mutation hazards, IL-scanned against Assembly-CSharp 1.6.9676.17735
    ///
    ///   * `HediffSet.PainTotal` and `.BleedRateTotal` write `cachedPain` /
    ///     `cachedBleedRate`. They are memos behind an explicit dirty flag that
    ///     RimWorld's own health tab refreshes every frame it draws; they change
    ///     no game state. Same class as `SummaryHealthPercent`. Reported here
    ///     rather than avoided, because the alternative is not reporting pain.
    ///   * `PawnCapacitiesHandler.GetLevel` fills a per-capacity cache AND
    ///     contains a `Verse.Log.Error` -- which pauses the game. That branch is
    ///     the infinite-recursion guard (`status == Caching`), which cannot fire
    ///     from a plain read on the main thread with nothing else re-entering
    ///     it. It also short-circuits on a dead pawn, so capacities are not read
    ///     for the dead at all.
    ///   * Everything else on the list -- `Hediff.LabelCap`, `.SeverityLabel`,
    ///     `.Severity`, `.Part`, `.Bleeding`, `.Visible`, `.TendableNow()`,
    ///     `HediffUtility.IsTended()`,
    ///     `HealthUtility.TicksUntilDeathDueToBloodLoss()`,
    ///     `Need.CurLevelPercentage`, `MentalBreaker.BreakThreshold*`,
    ///     `RestUtility.InBed()` -- was IL-scanned and stores nothing.
    ///
    /// ## equipment -- added 2026-09-02, after the gap killed somebody
    ///
    /// Five sessions of Lampblack's chronicle called Lucas "the colony's only
    /// fighter, charge rifle". On day 40 a warg took her at the map edge and
    /// M watched her fight it WITH HER HANDS. She had never carried a
    /// weapon. The save file agrees: only Longhoff has a gun.
    ///
    /// Hands had been asking. `home/list_pawns {equipment: true}` was called for
    /// five sessions and came back `equipment: None` every single time, and the
    /// note that went into `state\hands-last.md` read it as a limitation of the
    /// tool rather than an answer:
    ///
    ///     "`home/list_pawns {equipment:true}` returns `equipment: None` for
    ///      every colonist -- there is no way to read a weapon from it, which is
    ///      exactly the blind spot that killed Lucas."
    ///
    /// ### The defect
    ///
    /// The flattest one available: **there was no `equipment` parameter and no
    /// `equipment` key.** Not a parse bug, not a guard that never fired, not a
    /// serialiser dropping a field -- it was never written. The SDK binds only
    /// the parameters a tool DECLARES with `[ToolParameter]`, so `equipment:
    /// true` was discarded at the door without complaint; the per-pawn row
    /// dictionary then never grew the key; and `pawns.py` reads pawn fields with
    /// `.get()`, which turns an absent key into Python `None`.
    ///
    /// So "this build cannot answer that" and "the game says no weapon" arrived
    /// as the same four characters, and the reader picked the one that matched
    /// what the chronicle already said. That is the silent-absence failure this
    /// whole companion exists to end, and it cost a colonist.
    ///
    /// ### The rule this block is written under
    ///
    /// **Never null.** `health` and `needs` may return null for a pawn with no
    /// such tracker, because "a mechanoid has no needs" is a true and harmless
    /// answer. `equipment` may not: a null there is the exact shape that got
    /// read as "armed". So when `equipment: true` is passed the block is ALWAYS
    /// a dictionary --
    ///
    ///   * `armed` is a plain bool, always present;
    ///   * `primary` is null ONLY next to `armed: false`, and `primaryLabel`
    ///     spells that out as the literal string "unarmed";
    ///   * a pawn with no equipment tracker at all (every animal) says so in
    ///     `hasEquipmentTracker: false` rather than by being absent, and still
    ///     reports `armed: false` -- a warg is genuinely not carrying a rifle.
    ///
    /// `unarmedColonists` is lifted to the top level for the same reason: the
    /// question that was never asked was "who has nothing?", and a caller should
    /// get that answer without walking the list itself.
    ///
    /// ### Mutation hazards, IL-scanned against the same assembly
    ///
    /// `Pawn_EquipmentTracker.Primary` (indexes its ThingOwner),
    /// `Pawn_ApparelTracker.WornApparel` (returns the inner list),
    /// `ThingDef.IsWeapon` / `.IsRangedWeapon` / `.IsMeleeWeapon` (read
    /// `verbs` and `tools`) and `QualityUtility.TryGetQuality` (reads
    /// `CompQuality.Quality`, unwrapping a MinifiedThing first) call nothing
    /// that writes and nothing on the `Verse.Log.Error` -> `TickManager.Pause`
    /// path. This block is a pure read.
    ///
    /// ### bodyPartGroups / apparelLayers -- added 2026-09-02
    ///
    /// The Scout's gear section had to infer "nothing covering the legs" from
    /// GARMENT NAMES and printed a warning admitting it was guessing.
    /// `ThingDef.apparel` is a public `ApparelProperties` whose `bodyPartGroups`
    /// (`List&lt;BodyPartGroupDef&gt;`) and `layers` are both public fields --
    /// verified by reflection, not assumed -- so every gear row now carries what
    /// the garment actually covers. Both lists are ALWAYS present and empty for
    /// a non-apparel item, so "covers nothing" and "this is a rifle" are told
    /// apart by `isApparel`, never by a missing key.
    /// `BodyPartGroupDef.LabelShortCap` memoises `cachedLabelShortCap` on the
    /// shared def; same class of memo as `PainTotal`, no game state changes.
    ///
    /// ## bio -- added 2026-09-02 (M, on what a Hands session opens with)
    ///
    ///     "when a new hands session starts, i think they should automatically
    ///      be handed a list of colony pawns (human ones not animals) with: bio
    ///      (skills/traits), gear, needs, thoughts, and mood."
    ///
    /// Before this, `home/list_pawns` could answer health, needs and (as of this
    /// morning) equipment, and contained the strings "skill", "trait", "thought"
    /// and "backstory" exactly zero times. The whole left-hand column of the
    /// character card -- who this person IS -- was unreadable from the bridge,
    /// so every question about it went to the UI or went unanswered.
    ///
    /// ### `incapableOf` is the field this block exists for
    ///
    /// It is the one that stops an alarm nobody can act on. M, watching
    /// the Scout's new gear section run live:
    ///
    ///     "the scout should have pawns incapable of violence marked otherwise
    ///      theyll always have a line in their report about finn being unarmed."
    ///
    /// Finn is incapable of violence. Arming him is not a thing anyone can do.
    /// Without this field the Scout reports him UNARMED on every brief forever
    /// -- an alarm that never clears, which is worse than no alarm because it
    /// teaches the reader to skim the names that DO matter. It is also the
    /// answer to "why is this colonist idle?", which `rota.py`'s Scout brief has
    /// had to file as an unanswerable question, because the Work tab cannot be
    /// read from the bridge at all.
    ///
    /// **Both spellings are emitted.** `incapableOf[]` is the labels the game
    /// draws ("Violent", "Intellectual") because that is what a reader and a
    /// stream viewer recognise; `incapableOfTags[]` is the raw `Verse.WorkTags`
    /// names for a caller that wants to match on something stable. Neither is
    /// ever the only one present.
    ///
    /// **Empty and unreadable are different values.** `incapableOfRead` is a
    /// bool: false means the work tags could not be obtained at all (an animal
    /// has no story tracker), and `incapableOfNote` says why in words. A
    /// consumer told to treat an absent `bio` as "filter not applied" rather
    /// than "everyone is capable" needs that distinction to be real rather than
    /// hoped for -- it is the same silent-absence trap that killed Lucas, one
    /// field over.
    ///
    /// ### Where "incapable" actually comes from, IL-scanned
    ///
    /// `Verse.Pawn.CombinedDisabledWorkTags` is the complete union, and is what
    /// the character card itself reads. Its IL ORs together, in order:
    /// `Pawn_StoryTracker.DisabledWorkTagsBackstoryTraitsAndGenes` (itself
    /// `DisabledWorkTagsBackstoryAndTraits | Pawn_GeneTracker.DisabledWorkTags`
    /// -- that is the real 1.6 member name, read off the assembly, not guessed),
    /// every royal title in `royalty.AllTitlesForReading`, the pawn's ideoligion
    /// role, every hediff stage's disabled tags, any `QuestPart_WorkDisabled`
    /// naming the pawn, and the mutant tracker. A backstory-disabled tag and a
    /// trait-disabled tag both land here, and so does a temporary one from a
    /// quest -- which is why the narrower story-only property is reported
    /// alongside it as `incapableOfFromBackstoryTraitsGenes[]`, so a caller can
    /// tell a permanent incapability from a quest-imposed one.
    ///
    /// A Brawler is deliberately NOT in this list: a brawler can fight, he just
    /// cannot be handed a ranged weapon. That is a trait, and it is in `traits[]`.
    ///
    /// ### Mutation hazards in bio, IL-scanned against Assembly-CSharp 1.6.9676.17735
    ///
    ///   * **`TraitSet.TraitsSorted` is not used, deliberately.** Its body is
    ///     `tmpTraits.Clear()`, refill, `SortBy` -- it rewrites a per-pawn
    ///     scratch list and hands back a reference to it, so two readers overlap
    ///     and the second wins. `TraitSet.allTraits` is a public field holding
    ///     the real list, and is copied instead.
    ///   * `Pawn.CombinedDisabledWorkTags` calls
    ///     `QuestUtility.GetWorkDisabledQuestPart`, which does `Clear()` +
    ///     `Add()` on a static scratch list. Transient, main-thread only, no
    ///     game state; the character card does the same every frame it draws.
    ///   * `SkillRecord.Level` -> `GetLevel(true)` fills `cachedTotallyDisabled`,
    ///     `cachedPermanentlyDisabled` and `aptitudeCached`, and reaches
    ///     `TraitDef.DataAtDegree`, whose out-of-range arm is a `Verse.Log.Error`.
    ///     That arm needs a trait carrying a degree its own def does not define,
    ///     which no valid save produces -- the same argument the health block
    ///     already makes for `PawnCapacitiesHandler.GetLevel`. `levelStored`
    ///     carries the raw `levelInt` beside it, so a caller has the un-aptituded
    ///     number regardless.
    ///   * **`Pawn_SkillTracker.GetSkill(def)` is not used, deliberately.** Its
    ///     miss branch is a `Verse.Log.Error`, and Log.Error pauses the colony.
    ///     The skill list is built by walking
    ///     `DefDatabase&lt;SkillDef&gt;.AllDefsListForReading` -- the exact order
    ///     `SkillUI.DrawSkillsOf` draws, confirmed in its IL -- and matching
    ///     against `pawn.skills.skills` by reference here, so a def with no
    ///     record reports `present: false` instead of pausing the game.
    ///   * `WorkTypeDefsUtility.LabelTranslated` ends in a `Verse.Log.Error` for
    ///     an unknown or mixed tag. Its switch covers all 21 values of
    ///     `Verse.WorkTags` (counted in the IL), so single-bit splitting plus an
    ///     `Enum.IsDefined` guard makes that arm unreachable.
    ///   * `Trait.LabelCap` and `BodyPartGroupDef.LabelShortCap` memoise a
    ///     capitalised string on the shared def. Memos, not state.
    ///
    /// ## thoughts -- added 2026-09-02, and the nastiest hazard in this file
    ///
    /// What the Mood tab shows: every memory and situational thought with the
    /// mood it contributes, worst first.
    ///
    /// ### The API the UI uses can DELETE a colonist's memories
    ///
    /// `NeedsCardUtility` draws the Mood tab with
    /// `ThoughtHandler.GetDistinctMoodThoughtGroups` / `GetMoodThoughts` /
    /// `MoodOffsetOfGroup`. Reaching for those is the obvious move and it is
    /// wrong. IL, top to bottom:
    ///
    ///     GetDistinctMoodThoughtGroups -> GetAllMoodThoughts
    ///       -> SituationalThoughtHandler.AppendMoodThoughts
    ///       -> UpdateAllMoodThoughts             (stores thoughtsDirty = false)
    ///       -> Thought_Situational.RecalculateState
    ///       -> Thought_Situational.Notify_BecameActive
    ///       -> MemoryThoughtHandler.RemoveMemoriesOfDef
    ///
    /// `Notify_BecameActive` is one branch long and its whole body is: if
    /// `def.producesMemoryThought` is set, **remove every memory of that def
    /// from the pawn**. That is not a cache refresh and not a memo -- it is a
    /// permanent edit to a colonist's mind, fired as a side effect of asking
    /// what their mood is. RimWorld does it to itself on its own tick
    /// (`Need_Mood` -> `TotalMoodOffset` walks the same path), which is exactly
    /// why it reads as harmless in a decompiler; doing it from a bridge call on
    /// a PAUSED game is an out-of-band edit to the save.
    ///
    /// ### What is read instead
    ///
    ///   * memories: `thoughts.memories.Memories` -- a property whose entire IL
    ///     is `ldarg.0; ldfld; ret`. There is no purer read in the game.
    ///   * situational: the private `SituationalThoughtHandler.cachedThoughts`
    ///     list, by reflection, WITHOUT calling the recalculating getter. That
    ///     is precisely what the Mood tab drew on the last frame the game
    ///     computed mood -- and since `Need_Mood` recomputes on its own need
    ///     interval, on a paused game it is the number the player is looking at
    ///     on screen. `situationalCacheStale` carries the handler's own
    ///     `thoughtsDirty` flag so a caller is never guessing how fresh it is,
    ///     and `situationalCacheReadable` says outright whether the private
    ///     field was found at all, rather than reporting an empty list.
    ///   * grouping: done here with `Thought.GroupsWith`, the same predicate
    ///     `GetDistinctMoodThoughtGroups` uses, which reads `CurStageIndex`,
    ///     compares labels, and stores nothing.
    ///
    /// `Thought.MoodOffset()` opens with `if (CurStage == null) Log.Error(..)`,
    /// so `CurStage` is tested HERE before every call and that arm is dead.
    ///
    /// ### moodOffset is the STACKED TOTAL
    ///
    /// Said once, plainly, because half the value of this block is that a caller
    /// can add it up: in every `memories[]` and `situational[]` row,
    /// **`moodOffset` is the total the whole stack contributes**, not the
    /// per-instance value. `count` is how many identical thoughts were stacked
    /// and `moodOffsetEach` is the per-instance number. `moodOffsetTotal` is the
    /// sum of every row in both lists, so `sum(rows) == moodOffsetTotal` is a
    /// check a caller can actually run.
    ///
    /// ## work / schedule / settings / relations -- added 2026-09-02
    ///
    /// The configuration half of a colonist: the Work tab, the Assign tab and
    /// the Social tab. `WANTED.md` item 1 called the work tab *"top priority
    /// among the tools themselves"*; item 11 listed schedule, allowed area,
    /// medical care, self-tend and hostility response as having **no read or
    /// write path at all**. Both were true until these four blocks: the only
    /// way to see a work priority was `ui.py`'s pixel-pairing over an open Work
    /// tab, and `PLAYBOOK.md` said in so many words that the numbers were an
    /// OCR read rather than an assertion.
    ///
    /// `relations` is M's, 2026-09-02: *"family/relationships, since that
    /// can be relevant."*
    ///
    /// They are blocks on THIS tool rather than a second read tool because they
    /// hang off the same `Pawn` object as the five above -- the house pattern
    /// this file is the example of. The WRITE half is `home/pawn_config`, which
    /// is a separate tool because a write needs a plan, a refusal channel and a
    /// dry run that a filter argument cannot carry. **Both use the same
    /// builders** (`PawnSettingsRead`), so a write tool cannot report an "after"
    /// this tool would not show.
    ///
    /// All four take the never-null contract of `equipment{}` / `bio{}`: an
    /// animal gets a `work{}` saying `applies: false`, never a missing key.
    ///
    /// ## animals -- added 2026-09-03 (WANTED 7, the Animals tab)
    ///
    /// The last whole TAB with no read path. `list_pawns` has returned every
    /// animal on the map since the day it was written -- with `animal: true`, a
    /// position and a job -- and could not say whether one was tame, what it had
    /// been trained to do, who it was bonded to, or that somebody had marked it
    /// for slaughter. So "which of our animals can haul?" and "is the muffalo
    /// about to be butchered?" were both questions that had to be answered by
    /// opening the tab on stream.
    ///
    /// `animals: true` adds an `animals{}` block. Same never-null contract as
    /// the seven above: a humanlike gets `applies: false` and `isAnimal: false`,
    /// not a missing key. An absent key and a build that predates this are the
    /// same four characters to a caller, and that confusion has already cost
    /// this colony a colonist once (see `equipment` above).
    ///
    /// ### It does NOT narrow the list, and that is deliberate
    ///
    /// Every other block is a colonist question, so `pawns.py` narrows to
    /// colonists whenever one is asked for. This one is an ANIMAL question and
    /// narrowing it the same way would return nothing. The narrowing is a
    /// `pawns.py` behaviour and not a DLL one -- the tool's row set is
    /// unchanged, `animals:true` adds a block and filters nothing -- so
    /// `pawns.py --animals` narrows to living animals instead, and says so in
    /// its footer. The two top-level counts `animalCount` and `tameAnimalCount`
    /// are there so a caller doing its own narrowing can check its arithmetic
    /// against the tool's.
    ///
    /// ### Nothing in it is a second copy of something else
    ///
    /// `master`, `followDrafted`, `followFieldwork` and `allowedArea` are on the
    /// Animals tab and are NOT repeated in this block -- they are in
    /// `settings{}`, from the reader `home/pawn_config` writes through. Hunger
    /// is in `needs{}`. `animals.settingsBlockCarries` says so in the payload,
    /// because a field that exists in two places is a field whose two copies
    /// will eventually disagree.
    ///
    /// **The hazards in these five are documented on `PawnSettingsRead`**, and
    /// two of them are the same class as the memory-deletion trap above:
    /// `Pawn_WorkSettings.GetPriority` writes a whole priority table onto a pawn
    /// that never had one (and Log.Errors on the way, which pauses the colony),
    /// and `Pawn_RelationsTracker.OpinionOf` recalculates situational social
    /// thoughts, which DELETES memories. Neither is called on those paths. Read
    /// that class before touching any of them.
