    ///   unpause. If the speed is changed under it, it returns "speed_changed"
    ///   and does NOT restore. It never sets DebugViewSettings.neverForceNormalSpeed
    ///   or UltraSpeedBoost, so nothing it does outlives the call.
    /// * It pauses AT MOST ONCE, on a watch hit, and only while curTimeSpeed is
    ///   not already Paused.
    /// * Companion tools dispatch with MarshalToMainThread = false. Every read of
    ///   game state happens inside one ctx.MainThread.InvokeAsync hop per poll.
    /// * There are THREE notification channels, not two. Letters persist, alerts
    ///   persist, and MESSAGES (the fading top-left text) expire 13 REAL seconds
    ///   after they appear. A watch that skips messages loses every message-only
    ///   event with no trace and no way to recover it afterwards.
    /// * Alert state is READ, never recalculated. AlertsReadout.activeAlerts is
    ///   maintained by RimWorld's own per-frame readout cycle; Alert.Active,
    ///   Alert.Label and Alert.Priority are plain field reads (verified against
    ///   Assembly-CSharp 1.6.9676.17735: no Alert subclass overrides Priority,
    ///   and none of the three getters stores anything). Alert.Recalculate() and
    ///   Alert.GetReport() are the recalculation path and are never called.
    /// * GameCondition.TicksLeft and .Duration call Log.ErrorOnce on a PERMANENT
    ///   condition, and Log.Error calls TickManager.Pause(). Reading either
    ///   without checking Permanent first would pause the game as a side effect.
    /// * SummaryHealthPercent memoises into cachedSummaryHealthPercent when
    ///   dirty. That is the only write this tool can cause, it is a cache the UI

        //
        //  (a) THE KEY WAS UNSTABLE. RimWorld.BreakRiskAlertUtility.AlertLabel
        //      appends " x" + count when more than one colonist qualifies:
        //      "Mood break risk: minor" and "Mood break risk: minor x3" are the
        //      same alert with two different labels, so the entry baseline held
        //      one and the poll saw the other. NormalizeAlertLabel strips that
        //      suffix out of the key (never out of the reported label).
        //
        //  (b) THE ALERT GENUINELY FLAPS. AlertsReadout.AlertsReadoutUpdate
        //      re-checks 1/24th of the alert list per FRAME (AlertCycleLength
        //      24, ~0.4 s at 60 fps) and CheckAddOrRemoveAlert adds or removes

        //      it is MentalBreaker.BreakMinorIsImminent, a strict `<` of the

        //      alert that has been on screen for minutes.
