    /// Vanilla pawn orders issued **as jobs**, with no float menu anywhere near
    /// them.
    ///
    /// ## Why this exists
    ///
    /// On 2026-09-04 two colonists died while the agent playing could not get an
    /// attack order through. Every failure was in the float-menu path, not in
    /// the game:
    ///
    ///   * a target named by ThingID resolved to nothing, and a target named by
    ///     label was "ambiguous" because two rats shared a name;
    ///   * a DOWNED manhunter one cell away was refused, because a downed pawn
    ///     drops its mental state and falls off the hostiles list;
    ///   * a timber wolf that had just killed a colonist was refused for being
    ///     "not hostile any more" -- vanilla lets a drafted pawn melee ANY pawn,
    ///     and hostility is not a precondition anywhere in the game's own code;
    ///   * `open_context_menu` returned zero options because the SELECTING pawn
    ///     was in a mental break, which `FloatMenuMakerMap` refuses outright.
    ///
    /// So: no menu, no synthesised clicks. Resolve the pawn and the target, run
    /// the same checks vanilla runs, build the same `Job` vanilla builds, and
    /// hand it to `Pawn_JobTracker.TryTakeOrderedJob`. Then read `Pawn.CurJob`
    /// back and say whether the game actually took it.
    ///
    /// ## The four id forms
    ///
    /// `Rat361788` matched nothing on the old path, which is the whole bug in
    /// one string. Every spawned thing here answers to all four of:
    ///
    ///   1. `Thing_Rat361788`  -- `Thing.GetUniqueLoadID()`, what `home/status`
    ///      prints as `thingId`;
    ///   2. `Rat361788`        -- `Thing.ThingID`, defName + id;
    ///   3. `361788`           -- `Thing.thingIDNumber`, bare;
    ///   4. `rat` / `Longhoff` -- a label, name or nickname, case-insensitively,
    ///      exact first and then a unique substring.
    ///
    /// Forms 1-3 are EXPLICIT and can never be ambiguous: they either hit one
    /// thing or nothing at all. Only form 4 can tie, and a tie is answered with
    /// `candidates[]` carrying every id form of every candidate, so the caller
    /// learns the addresses it should have used.
    ///
    /// ## Hostility is never a precondition
    ///
    /// `requireHostile` exists, defaults to **false**, and is the only thing in
    /// this tool that looks at whether a target is hostile. `hostileToPlayer` is
    /// reported on every target as information. A downed target, a dead target,
    /// a tame animal and a pawn of the player's own faction all RESOLVE; only
    /// the action decides whether it will act on one.
    ///
    /// ## Everything is on the main thread
    ///
    /// Companion tools dispatch with `MarshalToMainThread = false`, so every
    /// game read and every write below is inside a `ctx.MainThread.InvokeAsync`
    /// hop, and every read goes through the `BridgeCommon.Try` guards -- an
    /// exception escaping into `Verse.Log.Error` calls `TickManager.Pause()`,
    /// which the harness reads as a person pressing space.
    ///
    /// `Faction.OfPlayer` is never called; `Faction.OfPlayerSilentFail` is.
    ///
    /// ## Hazards, IL-scanned against Assembly-CSharp 1.6.9676.17735
    ///
    ///   * **`ForbidUtility.SetForbidden(t, false)` is never called.** It has
    ///     three `Log.Error` arms -- a null thing, a non-`ThingWithComps`, and
    ///     one with no `CompForbiddable` -- and `Log.Error` calls
    ///     `TickManager.Pause()`. Its success arm is one line,
    ///     `comp.Forbidden = value`, which is what `Apply` does instead.
    ///   * **`ForbidUtility.IsForbidden` is never called.** The `(Thing,
    ///     Faction)` overload's body opens with `faction != Faction.OfPlayer`,
    ///     the banned getter, and the `(Thing, Pawn)` overload reaches it
    ///     through `pawn.Faction`. `CompForbiddable.Forbidden` is read direct.
    ///   * **Verified clean**, each grepped for `Log.Error` and `OfPlayer` in
    ///     the exact method called, not merely in the class:
    ///     `CellFinder.StandableCellNear` (pure radial walk),
    ///     `RCellFinder.BestOrderedGotoDestNear` (the class's three
    ///     `Log.Error`s are all in siege and map-edge finders),
    ///     `RestUtility.FindBedFor` (the class's four are in
    ///     `GetBedSleepingSlotPosFor` and `KickOutOfBed`, neither reachable
    ///     from it), `HealthAIUtility` and `EquipmentUtility` (no `Log.Error`
    ///     and no `OfPlayer` anywhere in either).
    ///   * `Pawn_JobTracker.TryTakeOrderedJob` emits `Log.Warning` -- not
    ///     `Log.Error` -- when a job's pre-toil reservations fail, and
    ///     `Log.Warning` has no `Pause()` in it. A failed reservation is
    ///     therefore a returned false, not a paused colony.
    ///   * `Pawn_MeleeVerbs.TryGetMeleeVerb` memoises `curMeleeVerb`. It is a
    ///     memo behind a tick stamp, the same class as `HediffSet.PainTotal`,
    ///     and it is the call `FloatMenuUtility.GetMeleeAttackAction` itself
    ///     makes, so the game is already making it on every right click.
    ///   * `Pawn_DraftController.Drafted`'s setter holds **no** guard at all --
    ///     no violence check, no mental-state check, no capability check. What
    ///     stops a player drafting a broken pawn is one level up, in
    ///     `Pawn.GetGizmos`, which draws the drafter's gizmos only when
    ///     `IsColonistPlayerControlled`. See `CanBeDrafted`.
