    /// list_messages, list_alerts, list_colonists and get_ui_state. Every block
    /// is present on every reply, empty rather than absent, so a caller never
    /// has to tell "nothing there" from "not asked". `colonists` and `threats`
    /// default true and can be switched off; `explanations` and `colonistDetail`
    /// are off and add bytes.
    ///
    /// Read-only. Nothing here writes, selects, opens a tab or moves the clock.
    ///
    /// ## Hazards this tool dodges
    ///
    /// * **`TickManager.TicksAbs` can PAUSE the game.** Its getter calls
    ///   `Log.ErrorOnce` when `gameStartAbsTick == 0`, and `Log.Error` calls
    ///   `TickManager.Pause()`. `gameStartAbsTick` (a public int FIELD) is
    ///   checked first; when it is 0 the tool reports `ticksAbs: null`,
    ///   `ticksAbsAvailable: false`, and the whole calendar goes null with it
    ///   because the calendar is a function of absolute ticks. Same guard as
    ///   home/get_time.
    /// * **`MapPawns.FreeColonistsSpawned` calls `Faction.OfPlayer`**, whose
    ///   body is `get_OfPlayerSilentFail` followed by `Verse.Log.Error` —
    ///   i.e. a pause. It is never used. Colonists come from
    ///   `MapPawns.AllPawnsSpawned` filtered on `Pawn.IsFreeColonist`, which
    ///   reads `Faction.IsPlayer` off the pawn and calls nothing that logs.
    /// * **`Faction.OfPlayer` is never called anywhere below.** Hostility uses
    ///   `Faction.OfPlayerSilentFail` and treats null as an answer.
    /// * **`Alert.GetReport()` is the recalculation path.** It is called here,
    ///   once per already-active alert, because it is the only source of the
    ///   culprits `targets[]` names — exactly what stock
    ///   `rimworld/list_alerts` does. `home/play_until_event` avoids it
    ///   because it polls in a loop with the clock running; a one-shot read is
    ///   a different cost. `Alert.Active` and `Alert.Label` are plain reads of
    ///   `cachedActive` / `cachedLabel` and are used for the cheap fields.
    /// * **`ChoiceLetter.Choices` constructs its DiaOptions on each get** and
    ///   some options call `CameraJumper.CanJump`. Allocation only; nothing is
    ///   invoked. Stock `rimworld/list_letters` does the same.
    /// * **`WindowStack.MouseObscuredNow` / `CurrentWindowGetsInput` are not
    ///   read**: both compare against `currentlyDrawnWindow`, which is only
    ///   meaningful inside OnGUI and is stale everywhere else.
