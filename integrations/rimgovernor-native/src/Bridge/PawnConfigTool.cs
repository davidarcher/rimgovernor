    /// ### `Pawn_WorkSettings.GetPriority` is NOT a pure read
    ///
    /// Its first line is `ConfirmInitializedDebug()`, whose whole body is:
    ///
    ///     if (priorities == null) { Log.Error(pawn + " did not have work
    ///                                         settings initialized.");
    ///                               EnableAndInitialize(); }
    ///
    /// `Verse.Log.Error` calls `TickManager.Pause()`, and `EnableAndInitialize`
    /// WRITES a fresh priority table onto the pawn. So asking an uninitialised
    /// pawn what its work priorities are would pause the colony AND assign it
    /// six jobs. `EverWork` / `Initialized` are both `priorities != null` and
    /// neither calls the guard, so they are tested FIRST here and `GetPriority`
    /// is never reached otherwise. `WorkIsActive` and `SetPriority` open with the
    /// same guard and are gated the same way.
    ///
    /// ### `GetPriority` LIES in simple mode, on purpose
    ///
    /// Its tail is `if (Humanlike && num > 0 && !Find.PlaySettings.useWorkPriorities)
    /// return 3;` — with the Work tab in checkbox mode, every active job reports
    /// priority 3 whatever is stored. Both numbers are emitted: `priority` is
    /// what the game acts on, `priorityStored` is the raw cell out of the private
    /// `DefMap&lt;WorkTypeDef,int&gt; priorities`, read through the map's own
    /// public indexer (`values[def.index]`, no guard, no masking). They differ
    /// only in simple mode, and `manualPriorities` says which mode is on.
    ///
    /// ### `Pawn_RelationsTracker.OpinionOf` can DELETE and CREATE memories
    ///
    /// The same trap as `ThoughtHandler.GetDistinctMoodThoughtGroups`, one field
    /// over, and it is not marked anywhere in the game:
    ///
    ///     OpinionOf -> ThoughtHandler.TotalOpinionOffset
    ///       -> GetDistinctSocialThoughtGroups -> GetSocialThoughts
    ///       -> SituationalThoughtHandler.AppendSocialThoughts
    ///       -> CheckRecalculateSocialThoughts   (creates the per-pawn cache
    ///                                            entry if absent)
    ///       -> Thought_SituationalSocial.RecalculateState
    ///       -> Thought_Situational.Notify_BecameActive   -> RemoveMemoriesOfDef
    ///          Thought_Situational.Notify_BecameInactive -> TryGainMemory
    ///
    /// A cache entry that does not exist yet is created with
    /// `lastRecalculationTick = -99999`, so `ShouldRecalculateState` is true on
    /// the FIRST query and every social situational thought transitions
    /// inactive -> active — which is exactly the branch that removes memories.
    /// Asking "what does Ada think of Bo?" would edit both colonists' minds.
    ///
    /// So `opinion` is RECONSTRUCTED from `OpinionOf`'s own arithmetic over pure
    /// reads, and says so in `opinionMethod`:
    ///
    ///   * relation offsets: `pawn.GetRelations(other)` summing
    ///     `PawnRelationDef.opinionOffset` — the same enumeration the social card
    ///     labels rows with. Its workers only read.
    ///   * memory offsets: `memories.Memories` filtered to `ISocialThought` whose
    ///     `OtherPawn()` is the other pawn, grouped with `Thought.GroupsWith`
    ///     (RimWorld's own predicate) and summed with
    ///     `Thought_MemorySocial.OpinionOffset()`, which is a pure read.
    ///   * situational-social offsets: the handler's private
    ///     `cachedSocialThoughts` dictionary, read by reflection WITHOUT
    ///     recalculating. When it holds no entry for the other pawn — normal, it
    ///     is only filled when something asked — `situationalSocialCached` is
    ///     false and the number is a floor, said out loud rather than passed off
    ///     as a total.
    ///   * then `OpinionOf`'s own tail: multiply by every hediff stage's
    ///     `opinionOfOthersFactor`, zero a positive opinion toward someone this
    ///     pawn is hostile to, clamp to -100..100.
    ///
    /// ### The animal block's own hazards are on AnimalBlock
    ///
    /// Three of them are worth knowing before reading that method: `GetSteps` is
    /// **internal** and reached by reflection; `Wildness` is a **stat**, not a
    /// `RaceProperties` field, and is only read for animals because

    /// `DesignationManager.DesignationOn(t, def)` is **not** used, because its
    /// wrong-target-type arm is a `Log.Error` — `AllDesignationsOn(t)` answers
    /// the same question with no error arm.
