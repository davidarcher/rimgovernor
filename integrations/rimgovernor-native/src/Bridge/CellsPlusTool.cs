    /// home/get_cells_plus — same rectangle semantics as rimworld/get_cells_info,
    /// plus the two fields that provably are NOT in the stock payload:
    ///
    ///   * per-thing `forbidden`  (CompForbiddable.Forbidden — the same bit the
    ///     save file writes as &lt;forbidden&gt;True&lt;/forbidden&gt;)
    ///   * per-bed  `ownerNames` / `ownerName` (Building_Bed.OwnersForReading)
    ///
    /// Verified 2026-08-30: 846 cells rescanned after items were forbidden and
    /// zero bytes of get_cells_info's payload changed, while the save XML showed
    /// 19 forbidden flags. So this is an addition, not a re-derivation.
    ///
    /// It is also deliberately more compact than get_cells_info, because the
    /// measured cost of the map sweep is payload size, not latency:
    ///   - the three duplicated def-name arrays (blueprintBuildDefs,
    ///     frameBuildDefs, solidThingDefs) are dropped; things[] already has them
    ///   - zone and area descriptors are emitted ONCE in top-level dictionaries
    ///     and referenced per cell by id, instead of repeated per cell
    ///   - className uses the short type name rather than the full namespace
    ///   - fields that are null/false/empty are omitted
    ///
    /// The one field that is NEVER omitted for a thing that could carry it is
    /// `forbidden`: a silently-absent forbidden flag is the exact bug this tool
    /// exists to fix, so any thing with a CompForbiddable reports true OR false.
    /// Things with no CompForbiddable (plants, filth, terrain-likes) omit the key
    /// entirely — absence there means "cannot be forbidden", not "unknown".
    ///
    /// ============================ 2026-09-02 ============================
    /// Two defects, both of them the same mistake in two places — treating an
    /// ABSENT key as if it were a VALUE. Written out in full because the second
    /// one is the compaction rule above biting its own author.
    ///
    /// 1. ARGUMENT SHAPE — a silent zero.
    ///    This tool declared only {x, z, width, height}. RimBridge's binder
    ///    (upstream AnnotatedExtensionCapabilityProvider.BuildArguments) does
    ///    NOT reject argument names a tool has not declared: it looks up each
    ///    DECLARED parameter by name, and anything the caller sent that does not
    ///    match one is dropped without a word. A declared parameter that nothing
    ///    supplied is then filled with `Activator.CreateInstance(typeof(int))`,
    ///    i.e. zero.
    ///    So a caller sending the corner form {x0, z0, x1, z1} — which is what
    ///    callers here have actually been sending — got x = 0, z = 0, and the
    ///    declared defaults width = 1, height = 1: a perfectly successful 1x1
    ///    scan of cell (0, 0), the map's bottom-left corner, which is fogged and
    ///    empty. Every thing in the requested rectangle vanished and
    ///    `success` stayed true. That is precisely the silent zero rim.py.game()
    ///    was hardened against on Aug 29 for refusals — except a refusal at
    ///    least says success:false, and this said success:true.
    ///    Fix: declare all eight names, default every one of them to a sentinel
    ///    no map coordinate can be, and refuse — loudly, naming the shape that
    ///    was parsed AND the shapes that are accepted — whenever the arguments
    ///    do not describe exactly one rectangle of at least one cell. There is
    ///    no path left through this tool that produces an empty or degenerate
    ///    rect and calls it success.
    ///
    /// 2. `passable` / `walkable` NULL ON EVERY CELL.
    ///    `passable` was never emitted at all — the field simply did not exist,
    ///    and a reader asking for it got None forever. `walkable` was emitted
    ///    ONLY when false, under the omit-falsey compaction above, so on every
    ///    walkable cell (the large majority) the key was absent and a reader
    ///    doing cell.get("walkable") got None there too — with no way to tell
    ///    "this cell is walkable" from "this tool did not report it". map.py
    ///    papered over its half of that in normalise_plus(); nothing else did.
    ///    Fix: both are emitted on EVERY cell, always, as real booleans.
    ///      walkable = IntVec3.Walkable(map)   — the PATH grid. A wall, a filled
    ///                 cell, an impassable building all read false. This is the
    ///                 question "can a pawn stand a path through here".
    ///      passable = !IntVec3.Impassable(map) — terrain/edifice passability,
    ///                 the same question ZonesTool asks with
    ///                 GetEdifice().def.passability == Traversability.Impassable.
    ///    They are NOT the same question and both are reported: a cell can be
    ///    passable terrain and still unwalkable to the path grid (and the
    ///    reverse, over a passable-but-unstandable edifice). If RimWorld throws
    ///    while answering either, the field carries the STRING "unknown" — never
    ///    null, because null and absent are the same thing once this is JSON,
    ///    and that confusion is the whole subject of this comment.
    ///    Cost: roughly 30 KB per 1024-cell block on top of the measured 152 KB
    ///    (against 649 KB for the stock tool). A boolean that is actually there
    ///    is worth 20%. `fogged` is deliberately left omit-when-false: every
    ///    reader of it already treats absence as false and gets that right.

    /// a rectangle gets exactly the payload it got yesterday, byte for byte.

///                    `capReason` on every reply say which cap applied.
    ///
    /// The rule the whole design turns on is the one this file already learned
    /// twice: A READER MUST BE ABLE TO TELL "DESELECTED" FROM "ABSENT". So
    ///   * `fieldsApplied[]` and `thingFieldsApplied[]` are on EVERY reply,
    ///     including the default one, naming exactly what was emitted. A key
    ///     missing from a cell is explained by that list or it is a bug.
    ///   * an unrecognised field name is REFUSED (success:false, naming the bad
    ///     name and listing the accepted ones). It is never ignored, because an
    ///     ignored name is a caller who thinks they narrowed and did not, or
    ///     thinks they asked for something and did not get it.
    ///   * `cellsOmitted` is on every reply, and
    ///     len(cells) + cellsOmitted == cellCount holds in all three modes.
    ///     `cellCount` stays the number of cells in the RECTANGLE, never the
    ///     number of entries in cells[] — a short answer that looks complete is
    ///     the failure this file exists against.
    ///
    /// Two judgement calls, written down because they are not derivable:
    ///
    ///   FOG IS NOT CONTENT. Under `sparse`, a fogged cell that holds nothing is
    ///   omitted like any other empty cell. `fogged` is a property OF the cell,
    ///   in the same class as terrain/roof/walkable/passable, not a thing lying
    ///   IN it; and a 32x32 block on the frontier is mostly fog, which is
    ///   exactly the payload sparse exists to remove. A fogged cell that holds a
    ///   thing or a designation is still returned, with its `fogged` flag, so
    ///   nothing that is actually there disappears. Callers that need the fog
    ///   SHAPE (map.py's layers all draw '?') must not use sparse — map.py does
    ///   not.
    ///
    ///   THE SUMMARY DE-DUPLICATES BY THING IDENTITY; cells[] DOES NOT. In
