    /// home/list_buildings — every building, blueprint and frame on the map in
    /// ONE call, with the construction deficit and the bill queue attached.
    ///
    /// ## Why this exists (M's to-do list, 2026-08-31, items 2 and 3)
    ///
    ///     2. "A construction-deficit check in the 5-minute Scout rotation --
    ///         list every building/blueprint/frame and what it still needs, so a
    ///         thing you are waiting on that is not being built gets reported
    ///         instead of silently sitting."
    ///
    ///     3. "A whole-map list of buildings and jobs for Scouts, background
    ///         calls only, no clicking. Seeded with colony context they could
    ///         then say things like 'we are low on food but the butcher spot has
    ///         no queued tasks.'"
    ///
    /// The design note recorded them as one missing tool, because the session
    /// that wrote them hit the gap twice in an hour: `home/list_things` returns
    /// items ONLY -- 27 kinds, zero buildings -- so finding the tailoring bench
    /// and reading the generator frame both fell back to sweeping raw cells,
    /// which is exactly the tile-by-tile pattern the companion was built to end.
    ///
    /// Three failures from that same day are the reason for three of the fields:
    ///
    ///   * A **mini-turret with no power source** sat there with no alert.
    ///     Nothing in this stack could see it; M caught it off the screen.
    ///     Hence `power`, and hence an unpowered building never gets aggregated
    ///     away -- it is always its own row.
    ///   * A **finished bill** ("Do X times", 0 left) is drawn identically to a
    ///     live one, and a colony once ran out of food behind one. Hence
    ///     `bills[].finished`, computed rather than trusted to the label.
    ///   * A **worktable with an empty bill queue** is invisible in every
    ///     instrument we have. Hence every bill giver gets an individual row even
    ///     when `billCount` is 0 -- that is the case M's item 3 asks for
    ///     by name.
    ///
    /// ## Payload discipline
    ///
    /// A whole-map building list is mostly wall segments; a naive dump is
    /// hundreds of identical rows. So built structures are **aggregated by def**
    /// (count + sample positions, the shape `home/list_things` already uses)
    /// while anything a caller could act on is **promoted** to a full individual
    /// row: every blueprint, every frame, every bill giver, every bed, every
    /// turret, and anything unpowered, switched off, broken down or out of fuel.
    /// Each promoted row carries `reasons[]` saying why it escaped aggregation,
    /// and each aggregate row carries `promotedOut` saying how many of that def
    /// left it. Nothing is dropped in silence; a filter that hides things states
    /// what it hid, and an empty answer is never ambiguous between "nothing
    /// there" and "nothing survived the filter".
    ///
    /// ## The aggregate row's count, and the day it stopped being trusted
    ///
    /// BUGS.md, 2026-09-02: *"`home/list_buildings` reports `count: 11` for
    /// PowerConduit but returns 8 positions."* Eight is `maxPositionsPerDef`'s
    /// default. Nothing was miscounted — but `count` was incremented on every
    /// instance while `positions[]` was appended to only while it was under the
    /// cap, which is **two accumulators for one fact**, and the only trace of
    /// the cap was a `positionsNotListed` a caller had to think to read. A row
    /// that needs the reader to already suspect truncation is the same failure
    /// as a silently absent field.
    ///
    /// So the row now keeps every instance's anchor cell and reads BOTH numbers
    /// off that one list at emit time: `count` is its length, `positions[]` is
    /// its first `maxPositionsPerDef` entries, and `positionsListed`,
    /// `positionsNotListed`, `positionsTruncated` and `positionsCap` state the
    /// cap in the row it truncated. `distinctCells` separates the other reason a
    /// count can exceed its coordinates — several things of one def on one cell
    /// — from the cap, because raising the cap fixes one and not the other.
    /// `promotedOut` (promised by these remarks since the tool was written, and
    /// never actually emitted until that same day) closes the last gap: `count +
    /// promotedOut` is the def's whole surviving population.
    ///
    /// The other half of that BUGS.md line — *"Growing zone 1 lists 7 cells
    /// while 43 crops stand in it"* — is not answerable here in any mode. A
    /// plant is `ThingCategory.Plant` and this tool enumerates Building /
    /// Blueprint / BuildingFrame only, so its silence about crops is not
    /// evidence about crops. `notes.plantsAndZonesNotIncluded` says so in the
    /// payload and points at `home/list_zones`, which counts plants over the
    /// zone's own cell list AND over the cells the zone grid actually gives it.
    ///
    /// ## Three things reflection said that guessing would have got wrong
    ///
    /// (All checked against the installed Assembly-CSharp.dll, RimWorld
    /// 1.6.9676.17735.)
    ///
    ///   1. **`Bill_Production.ShouldDoNow()` MUTATES the bill.** Its IL writes
    ///      the `paused` field at three separate sites. It is the obvious way to
    ///      ask "is this bill live", and calling it from a read-only listing tool
    ///      would silently un-pause bills every time a Scout looked at the map.
    ///      This tool never calls it. `finished` and `active` are derived from
    ///      fields only.
    ///   2. **`Blueprint_Build.BuildDef` and `Frame.BuildDef` are casts** --
    ///      `(ThingDef)def.entityDefToBuild`. Floors are blueprints too and their
    ///      `entityDefToBuild` is a `TerrainDef`, so reading `BuildDef` throws
    ///      `InvalidCastException` on any flooring job. We read the
    ///      `BuildableDef` field directly and never cast.
    ///   3. **`Blueprint` and `Frame` live in `RimWorld`, not `Verse`** (the
    ///      cell payload's `isBlueprint` / `isFrame` naming suggests otherwise),
    ///      and they are NOT in `ThingRequestGroup.BuildingArtificial`: they have
    ///      their own groups, `Blueprint` and `BuildingFrame`. Asking only for
    ///      BuildingArtificial -- the obvious single query -- returns a list with
    ///      no blueprint and no frame in it, which is precisely the half of the
    ///      question M asked for. We query all three groups and de-
    ///      duplicate by reference, so a group-membership change upstream cannot
    ///      silently lose a status.
    ///
    /// ## The inspect pane, opt-in (`inspect: true`, WANTED 14)
    ///
    /// `Thing.GetInspectString()` is the text the inspect pane draws, and it has
    /// no relationship whatever to the selection -- which dissolves WANTED 14's
    /// stated problem ("without needing the selection to succeed on a multi-cell
    /// building") rather than working around it. It is OFF by default because a
    /// whole-map call is measured at 17.2 KB and the strings roughly double a
    /// worktable row; when it is off, no row carries the key at all.
    ///
    /// Three things about it that were checked in the decompile, not assumed:
    ///
    ///   1. **`ThingWithComps.GetInspectString()` concatenates every comp's
    ///      `CompInspectStringExtra()`**, which is where the power line lives
    ///      (`CompPowerTrader` -> "Power output: 100 W", and its base
    ///      `CompPower` -> **"Not connected to a power grid"**), the fuel line,
    ///      and "Broken down". That comp text is the whole point of the item,
    ///      so it is included by construction, not by a separate read.
    ///   2. **`GetInspectStringLowPriority()` is NOT called, deliberately.**
    ///      `Verse.Building` overrides it and its first act is
    ///      `DeconstructibleBy(Faction.OfPlayer)` -- the banned property, whose
    ///      body is `OfPlayerSilentFail` followed by `Log.Error`, and
    ///      `Log.Error`'s call path contains `TickManager.Pause()`. Reading a
    ///      building's low-priority line on a map with no player faction would
    ///      PAUSE the colony. The pane's deterioration / "attack to destroy"
    ///      text is the only thing lost, and neither is worth that.
    ///   3. **The strings carry Verse rich text** -- `Building_Door` colorizes
    ///      "must be enclosed by walls" red, `CompMannable` colorizes its
    ///      warning. `&lt;color=...&gt;`, `&lt;b&gt;`, `&lt;i&gt;`, `&lt;size=...&gt;`
    ///      and their closers are stripped; a `&lt;` that is not a tag is left alone.
    ///
    /// The pane's own newlines become `" | "` so a row stays one line: this is
    /// read by an agent that prints it, and an array of four one-clause strings
    /// costs about twice the JSON of the joined string for the same words.
    ///
    /// **Aggregated rows get nothing.** An aggregate row is a def, not a thing;
    /// there is no single inspect string for eleven conduits, and picking one
    /// instance's would be a sample presented as a fact. Pass `aggregate:false`
    /// to get an inspect string for every wall.
    ///
    /// Known hazard, not fixable from here: `InspectStringPartsFromComps` calls
    /// `Log.ErrorOnce` when `Prefs.DevMode` is on AND a comp's string ends in
    /// whitespace (a modded comp, in practice -- vanilla trims). That is the
    /// `Log.Error` -> `TickManager.Pause()` path again, once per offending comp
    /// type. `notes.inspectDevModeWarning` appears when dev mode is actually on.
    ///
    /// ## Which cell is `position`
    ///
    /// `Thing.Position` -- RimWorld's own anchor cell for the building, the same
    /// one `get_cells_info` and `click_cell` use, so a coordinate from here can
    /// be handed straight to any other bridge tool. For a multi-cell building
    /// that is NOT the min corner, so the full footprint is reported separately
    /// as `occupies` (min/max/width/height from `GenAdj.OccupiedRect`). `occupies`
