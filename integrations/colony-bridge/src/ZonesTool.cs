    /// home/list_zones — every zone on the map, read-only, with the one thing no
    /// other instrument reports: whether the zone's own cell LIST and the map's
    /// zone GRID still agree about which cells it owns.
    ///
    /// ## Why the list/grid split is the whole point of this tool
    ///
    /// A zone is stored twice. `Zone.cells` is a plain `List&lt;IntVec3&gt;` on the
    /// zone; `ZoneManager.zoneGrid` is one `Zone` pointer per map cell. Every
    /// normal path writes both. `Zone.AddCell(c)` appends to its own list and then
    /// calls `zoneManager.AddZoneGridCell(this, c)` which OVERWRITES the grid
    /// pointer — it does NOT remove the cell from whatever zone had it before.
    /// The game's own `Designator_ZoneAdd.DesignateMultiCell` never hits that case
    /// because it drops every cell where `ZoneAt(c) != null` before adding. A
    /// caller that adds a cell directly does not, and the result is a zone whose
    /// list claims cells the grid gives to somebody else.
    ///
    /// That is not cosmetic. `SlotGroup.CellsList` is `parent.AllSlotCellsList()`,
    /// which for a stockpile is the zone's **list** — so hauling follows the list
    /// while rendering and `ZoneAt` follow the grid, and the save file logs
    /// `... overwriting slot group square (x, 0, z) of ...` on every load. So both
    /// counts are reported separately, every disagreement is named in `anomalies`
    /// as an English sentence, and `home/zone_cells` op=repair is the fix.
    ///
    /// ## Three reads that a plausible implementation would get wrong
    ///
    /// (Checked against the installed Assembly-CSharp.dll, RimWorld 1.6.)
    ///
    ///   1. **`Zone.Cells` (capital C) SHUFFLES the list in place.** Its getter
    ///      calls `cells.Shuffle()` the first time it is touched. Reading it from
    ///      a listing tool would reorder the colony's stockpile cells as a side
    ///      effect of looking at them. Everything here reads the `cells` FIELD.
    ///      Same trap in `Zone_Growing`'s `IPlantToGrowSettable.Cells`.
    ///   2. **`Zone_Growing.PlantDefToGrow` WRITES `plantDefToGrow`** when it is
    ///      null: the getter lazily assigns Potato (or Toxipotato on polluted
    ///      ground) and stores it. So this tool reads the private field by
    ///      reflection instead and reports `plantDef: null` with
    ///      `plantDefExplicitlySet: false`, which is the honest answer — the zone
    ///      has not been told what to grow yet.
    ///   3. **`Zone.CheckContiguous()` DELETES CELLS.** It flood-fills from
    ///      `cells[0]` and calls `RemoveCell` on everything it did not reach. It
    ///      is the obvious way to answer "is this zone contiguous" and it is a
    ///      destructive write. `contiguous` here is computed by a local 4-connected
    ///      flood fill over a copy of the list; nothing is touched.
    ///
    /// ## Why a growing zone counts its plants twice (2026-09-02)
    ///
    /// BUGS.md filed *"Growing zone 1 lists 7 cells while 43 crops stand in
    /// it"* against `home/list_buildings`. It is not a `list_buildings` defect —
    /// a plant is `ThingCategory.Plant` and that tool enumerates buildings,
    /// blueprints and frames, so it can never see a crop. It is the list/grid
    /// split above, seen from the crop side: seven listed cells cannot hold 43
    /// plants, and a grid that gives the zone 43 cells can. This tool was
    /// already reporting the divergence correctly in `listedCellCount` /
    /// `gridCellCount` — but it carried **no plant count at all**, so the 43 had
    /// to be counted somewhere else and there was nothing here to reconcile it
    /// against.
    ///
    /// A growing zone now reports `plantsInListedCells` and `plantsInGridCells`
    /// side by side, plus `cropPlantsIn*` for the def it was actually told to
    /// grow and a per-def `plants[]`. They are never merged: one plant count for
    /// a zone whose two cell sets disagree is a number that is quietly the
    /// answer to a different question. `plantCountsDisagree` says so in one
    /// field, and `home/zone_cells op=repair` is what makes the two agree.
    ///
    /// Read-only in the strict sense: no field on any game object is written, and
    /// no path that reaches `Verse.Log.Error` (which calls `TickManager.Pause()`)
    /// is entered. The plant sweep reads `map.thingGrid.ThingsListAtFast` and
    /// `ThingDef` fields only — the same reads the stockpile block has been
    /// making since this tool was written — and never touches `Plant` state or
    /// `Zone_Growing.PlantDefToGrow`, whose getter writes.
