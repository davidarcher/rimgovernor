    /// home/place_building — answer "can this go here, facing which way, and what
    /// is in the way" for one or all rotations, and then place the blueprint
    /// if asked. Callers must state `dryRun` explicitly; writes need one rotation.
    ///
    /// ## Why the rotation sweep is the whole point
    ///
    /// `Designator_Build.CanDesignateCell(c)` is
    /// `GenConstruct.CanPlaceBlueprintAt(entDef, c, placingRot, Map, ...)`, and
    /// `placingRot` is a **protected** field on `Designator_Place`. A bridge that
    /// drives the architect menu cannot set it, so every dry run it has ever
    /// answered was for one fixed rotation — usually North — and a caller reading
    /// "cannot place here" had no way to know that turning the thing would have
    /// worked. This tool takes the rotation as a parameter, calls
    /// `CanPlaceBlueprintAt` directly, and by default reports all four.
    ///
    /// ## Which face of a cooler is the cold one
    ///
    /// Read out of `Building_Cooler.TickRare`:
    /// `Position + IntVec3.South.RotatedBy(Rotation)` is the cell whose ROOM gets
    /// cooled, and `Position + IntVec3.North.RotatedBy(Rotation)` is where the heat
    /// is pushed. So a cooler wants its *south* face indoors and its *north* face
    /// out, and getting that backwards heats the room you meant to chill. Both
    /// cells are reported per rotation with their room, whether that room uses
    /// outdoor temperature, and the temperature there right now — which is enough
    /// to read off which orientation actually puts the hot side outside.
    ///
    /// `Building_Vent` is symmetric: `TickRare` calls
    /// `GenTemperature.EqualizeTemperaturesThroughBuilding(this, 14f, twoWay: true)`
    /// which averages the rooms at `cell + Rotation.FacingCell` and
    /// `cell - Rotation.FacingCell` over the building's occupied rect. For a 1x1
    /// vent those are the same two cells as the cooler's, so they are reported as
    /// `a` / `b` rather than hot / cold, because neither side is privileged.
    ///
    /// ## Designators are bypassed on purpose
    ///
    /// Nothing here touches `Find.DesignatorManager`. `Designator_Build` carries UI
    /// state (the selected stuff, the placing rotation, the mouse attachment) and
    /// driving it from a bridge call means mutating what the player sees. Placement
    /// is `GenConstruct.PlaceBlueprintForBuild(def, center, map, rot, faction,
    /// stuff)`, which is the same call the designator itself makes.
    ///
    /// ## The wipe has to happen, and with the right DestroyMode
    ///
    /// This tool used to skip `GenSpawn.WipeExistingThings` on the grounds that not
    /// destroying things is the safer default. It is not.
    /// `PlaceBlueprintForBuild` calls `GenSpawn.Spawn`, whose `wipeMode` defaults
    /// to `WipeMode.Vanish`, and Vanish runs
    /// `WipeExistingThings(..., DestroyMode.Vanish)` anyway. So the choice was
    /// never "wipe or do not wipe" -- it was "wipe with a refund or wipe without
    /// one". Placing over another def's frame under Vanish destroys the materials
    /// already delivered to it and returns nothing, where the architect menu
    /// refunds them.
    ///
    /// A real placement now does exactly what
    /// `Designator_Build.DesignateSingleCell` does, in the same order:
    ///
    ///   1. destroy any `Frame` in the ANCHOR cell whose `replaceTags` intersect
    ///      `entDef.blueprintDef.replaceTags`, with `DestroyMode.Cancel`;
    ///   2. `GenSpawn.WipeExistingThings(center, rot, entDef.blueprintDef, map,
    ///      DestroyMode.Deconstruct)` -- Deconstruct, so materials come back;
    ///   3. `PlaceBlueprintForBuild`, whose own Vanish wipe then finds nothing
    ///      left to destroy.
    ///
    /// Everything removed is reported as `wiped` / `framesCancelled`, and a dry run
    /// predicts both under `wipeOnPlace` / `framesCancelledOnPlace` using the same
    /// predicate, so the two cannot disagree.
    ///
    /// ## Log.Error avoidance
    ///
    /// `Verse.Log.Error` calls `TickManager.Pause()`. Two ordinary-looking calls on
    /// this path reach it and are avoided:
    ///
    ///   * `Rot4.FromString(s)` logs "Invalid rotation" for anything it does not
    ///     recognise. Rotation names are parsed here by hand.
    ///   * `CostListAdjusted(def, stuff)` defaults `errorOnNullStuff` to TRUE and
    ///     logs when a stuffed def is costed with a null stuff. It is called with
    ///     `errorOnNullStuff: false`.
    ///
    /// `Faction.OfPlayer` is likewise never used: its body is
    /// `get_OfPlayerSilentFail` followed by `Log.Error`.
