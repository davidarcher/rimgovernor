        // M did not know a trade had happened last session. Selecting the
        // trader and moving the camera is not enough: a deal executed headless
        // looks like nothing at all. So `accept` now opens the REAL Dialog_Trade,
        // holds it on screen, executes while it is up, and closes it.
        //
        // ## The wrinkle, and why this is not a "re-stage"
        //
        // `Dialog_Trade`'s only constructor is
        // `Dialog_Trade(Pawn playerNegotiator, ITrader trader, bool giftsOnly)`
        // and its body calls `TradeSession.SetupWith(...)`, which ends with an
        // unconditional `deal = new TradeDeal()`. `TradeDeal`'s constructor calls
        // `Reset()`, which clears the tradeable list and rebuilds it from
        // scratch. So merely constructing the window WIPES EVERY STAGED COUNT,
        // and `Tradeable` instance identity is not stable across two deals.
        //
        // The obvious repair -- snapshot (thing, count) pairs and re-apply them
        // to the new deal with `TransferableUtility.TradeableMatching` -- is
        // reachable but lossy: `TransferAsOne` groups on hit points within 10,
        // quality, stuff and `tradeNeverStack`, and the synthetic zero-stack
        // silver row is a brand new Thing on every deal and so matches nothing.
        // Any of those turns "the same trade" into "a similar trade", which is
        // the one thing a deal a person previewed may never become.
        //
        // `TradeSession.deal` is a PUBLIC STATIC FIELD, so there is an exact
        // route: keep the original `TradeDeal` OBJECT, let the constructor
        // install its throwaway, then put the original back BEFORE the window is
        // added to the stack. `Window.PostOpen` -> `Dialog_Trade.CacheTradeables`
        // reads `TradeSession.deal.AllTradeables` and stores REFERENCES to those
        // same `Tradeable` objects, so the dialog caches the original deal and
        // draws the original staged counts. Nothing is re-applied, nothing is
        // matched, and the rows on screen are the same objects `preview` costed.
        //
        // `Dialog_Trade.Close(bool)` neither nulls `TradeSession.trader` nor
        // calls `TradeSession.Close()` (which has no callers anywhere in
        // Assembly-CSharp), and it pops NO confirmation for pending changes --
        // the class does not override PreClose/PostClose/OnCancelKeyPressed, and
        // its only Dialog_MessageBoxes are the impaired-negotiator notice and the
        // trader-short-funds prompt. So the session and its counts survive the
        // window closing, which is what makes this sequence possible at all.
        //
        // The deal is still verified after the swap and again before it executes.

        // nothing: nothing is traded that was not previewed.
