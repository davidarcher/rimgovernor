    /// ## Why it exists
    ///
    /// Until now nothing in the stack could read research at all. The documented
    /// path was: open the Research tab on stream (a visible mutation), then trim
    /// a 204 KB `get_ui_layout` payload down to something readable. `Need
    /// research project` has been a standing Medium alert on this save, and the
    /// tool that would answer it was the tab itself.
    ///
    /// ONE tool with opt-in blocks, per the house pattern: the current project,
    /// what can be started, the benches and the people, always; `locked`,
    /// `finished` and `unlocks` on request; `filter` narrows every list; `set`
    /// is the write side and is a dry run until `dryRun:false`.
    ///
    /// ## Verified against the installed Assembly-CSharp.dll (RimWorld 1.6)

    /// ## The hazards this tool had to dodge
    ///
    /// ### `ResearchProjectDef.CostApparent` and `.ProgressApparent` call
    /// `Faction.OfPlayer`
    ///
    /// Their bodies are `Cost * CostFactor(Faction.OfPlayer.def.techLevel)`.
    /// `Faction.OfPlayer` is `OfPlayerSilentFail` followed by `Log.Error`, and
    /// `Verse.Log.Error` calls `TickManager.Pause()` — the same trap
    /// `home/list_buildings` and `home/pawn_config` document. Neither property is
    /// read here. `costApparent` is reconstructed from the def's own public
    /// `CostFactor(TechLevel)` over `Faction.OfPlayerSilentFail.def.techLevel`,
    /// and is **null** with `costApparentReadable:false` when there is no player
    /// faction, rather than silently falling back to the raw cost.
    ///
    /// ### `Pawn_SkillTracker.GetSkill` calls `Log.Error` on a miss
    ///
    /// Its tail is `Log.Error("Did not find skill of def ...")` followed by
    /// `return skills[0]` — so a pawn whose skill list does not contain
    /// Intellectual would pause the colony AND report the WRONG skill's level.
    /// `pawn.skills.skills` is walked by reference here instead, exactly as
    /// `home/list_pawns` walks it, and a pawn with no record reports
    /// `intellectual: null`.
    ///
    /// ### `Pawn_WorkSettings.WorkIsActive` is not a pure read
    ///
    /// `WorkIsActive` opens with `ConfirmInitializedDebug()`, whose whole body is
    /// `if (priorities == null) { Log.Error(...); EnableAndInitialize(); }` — it
    /// pauses the colony and assigns the pawn six jobs. `EverWork` is
    /// `priorities != null` and calls no guard, so it is tested FIRST and
    /// `WorkIsActive` is never reached otherwise. This is the same rule
    /// `home/pawn_config` states for `GetPriority`.
    ///
    /// ### `ResearchManager.CurrentAnomalyKnowledgeProjects` can be NULL
    ///
    /// Its getter calls `EnsureKnowledgeProjectsInitialized()`, which **returns
    /// immediately when `ModsConfig.AnomalyActive` is false** — leaving the
    /// backing list null. `GetProject(someCategory)` then `foreach`es over null
    /// and throws. So the per-category slots are only touched when Anomaly is
    /// active; without it `currentByCategory` is an empty object and
    /// `anomalyActive` is false, which is a different thing from "no category
    /// has a project".
    ///
    /// ### `ResearchManager.GetProgress` INSERTS a zero
    ///
    /// Read the source: on a miss it does `progress.Add(proj, 0f); return 0f;` —
    /// and `progress` is scribed into the save. `IsFinished`, `CanStartNow` and
    /// `ProgressPercent` all route through it, so **any** honest read of research
    /// state adds a zero row per project the colony has never touched. This is
    /// exactly what vanilla does the first time a player opens the Research tab
    /// (the tree draws every node's `ProgressPercent`), and a zero row is
    /// semantically identical to an absent one. It is written down here because
    /// "this read is free" would be false, and `notes.progressDictionaryNote`
    /// says it in the payload too. The progress NUMBER itself is read from the
    /// private `progress` dictionary by reflection, with no insert, so at least
    /// the reported value costs nothing; `progressReadMethod` says which path
    /// answered.
    ///
    /// ### The write does what the Research tab's button does, minus the UI
    ///
    /// `MainTabWindow_Research.DoBeginResearch` is exactly three statements:
    ///
    ///     SoundDefOf.ResearchStart.PlayOneShotOnCamera();
    ///     Find.ResearchManager.SetCurrentProject(projectToStart);
    ///     TutorSystem.Notify_Event("StartResearchProject");
    ///     (+ a Messages.Message when the colony has no bench)
    ///
    /// This tool calls the middle two. The sound is UI and is skipped — WANTED 0
    /// (watchability) is the item that will decide whether a write should be
    /// audible or visible, and guessing now would prejudge it. The
    /// no-bench message is skipped because `researchBenches{}` answers the same
    /// question in the reply, in writing. `AttemptBeginResearch`'s Ideology
    /// confirmation dialog (unlocked defs whose memes the colony lacks) is also
    /// skipped: it is a confirmation, and a caller who passed `dryRun:false`
    /// has confirmed. `missingMemeUnlocks[]` on the write row reports what that
    /// dialog would have listed, so nothing is hidden by not asking.
    ///
    /// `SetCurrentProject` only assigns `currentProj` when `proj.baseCost > 0`;
    /// an Anomaly knowledge project (baseCost 0, knowledgeCost > 0) goes into its
    /// knowledge-category slot instead. The `after` here is read back from the
    /// game through `GetProject()` and `GetProject(category)`, so which slot
    /// moved is visible rather than assumed.
