    /// ## op=crop, and the getter that writes
    ///
    /// `op=crop` calls `Zone_Growing.SetPlantDefToGrow`. The before/after read is
    /// the private `plantDefToGrow` FIELD, never the `PlantDefToGrow` property:
    /// that getter assigns the field when it is null, so reading it to report the
    /// current crop would set one. A zone that has never been told what to grow
    /// therefore reports null rather than the potatoes the property would invent.
    ///
    /// ## op=filter, and why it runs twice
    ///
    /// `op=filter` writes `Zone_Stockpile.settings`: the `ThingFilter` and the
    /// `StoragePriority`. A preset, then `allow`, then `disallow`, then the
    /// priority. The whole plan is first applied to a scratch `ThingFilter`
    /// seeded with `CopyAllowancesFrom(the live one)` — the game's own code doing
    /// the game's own work on a copy — which is what a dry run returns and what
    /// `changed` is computed from. A real run then replays the identical calls
    /// against the live filter and reads the answer back off it. See
    /// <see cref="StockpileFilter"/> for the preset definitions.
    ///
    /// ## Two hops, because the menu opens before the write
    ///
    /// Hop 1 resolves the zone and opens the watch (the storage tab for
    /// `op=filter`, the zone's inspect pane otherwise); a lead runs off-thread so
    /// the open menu is on screen; hop 2 plans, applies, reads back and closes.
    /// The planner and the write stay inside hop 2 together, so nothing can
    /// change between deciding and doing. The watch is decorative: hop 1's
    /// resolve is only there to aim the camera, and hop 2 re-resolves and is the
    /// only thing that can refuse.
    ///
    /// ## The bug this tool exists to not repeat, and to clean up after
    ///
    /// `Zone.AddCell(c)` appends to the zone's own `cells` list and then calls
    /// `zoneManager.AddZoneGridCell(this, c)`, which OVERWRITES the grid pointer.
    /// It does not remove the cell from the zone that had it. The game never hits
    /// that case: `Designator_ZoneAdd.DesignateMultiCell` drops every cell where
    /// `ZoneAt(c) != null` before adding any. The bridge's upstream
    /// `apply_architect_designator` calls `AddCell` directly on cells that
    /// `CanDesignateCell` accepted — and `CanDesignateCell` accepts a cell that is
    /// already in a same-type zone — so it produced a stockpile whose list holds
    /// two cells the grid gives to a different stockpile. On load the game prints
    /// `Stockpile zone 2 overwriting slot group square (113, 0, 145) of Stockpile
    /// zone 1`, twice.
    ///
    /// So `op=add` does the step that was skipped: `owner.RemoveCell(c)` FIRST,
    /// then `target.AddCell(c)`, and every row says what it was taken from.
    ///
    /// ## Why the repair cannot just call Delete()
    ///
    /// `Zone.RemoveCell(c)` removes from the list and then calls
    /// `zoneManager.ClearZoneGridCell(c)` — it clears whoever the GRID says owns
    /// the cell, not itself. `Zone.Delete()` is a loop of `RemoveCell`. So
    /// deleting the phantom zone would blank the other zone's grid cells and turn
    /// one inconsistency into two. `op=repair` therefore edits the `cells` list
    /// directly and never touches the grid.
    ///
    /// ## Four Log.Error landmines, all of which pause the colony
    ///
    /// `Verse.Log.Error` calls `TickManager.Pause()`. Every one of these is an
    /// ordinary-looking call on a plausible repair path, and every one is
    /// pre-checked here rather than caught afterwards (an exception is not thrown
    /// — the game logs and carries on, having already paused):
    ///
    ///   1. `Zone.AddCell(c)` logs when `cells.Contains(c)` is already true, and
    ///      when a thing at the cell has `!def.CanOverlapZones`.
    ///   2. `Zone.RemoveCell(c)` logs when `!cells.Contains(c)`.
    ///   3. `SlotGroup.Notify_LostCell(c)` -> `HaulDestinationManager.ClearCellFor`
    ///      logs when the haul group grid at that cell is NOT this slot group.
    ///      That is exactly the state a phantom cell is in, so the repair checks
    ///      `SlotGroupAt(c) == slotGroup` first and reports "notify skipped" when
    ///      it does not hold, rather than pausing the game to be tidy.
    ///   4. `SlotGroup.Notify_AddedCell(c)` -> `SetCellFor` logs when the haul
    ///      group grid at that cell is already non-null.
    ///
    /// `Rot4.FromString` and `CostListAdjusted(def, null)` are on the same list and
    /// are avoided in home/place_building for the same reason.
    ///
    /// ## Dry run is a simulation, not a guess
    ///
    /// Every op is planned against an in-memory copy of the affected zones' cell
    /// lists, the zone grid and the haul group grid, cell by cell in order, so a
    /// later cell sees the effect of an earlier one (including a previous owner
    /// emptying out and deregistering). `dryRun: true` returns that plan and stops;
    /// `dryRun: false` replays exactly the same recorded actions against the game.
    /// The two cannot drift, because there is only one planner.
