# Planner-owned pawn activities

`PawnActivities` is a Hands intent for installing/revising/releasing an atomic set
of exact per-pawn assignments. It is an execution capability; no production
selector automatically takes over colonists yet. #3127/#3128/#3132/#3135 provide
selection, needs forecasting and the normal-operation cutover.

The existing executor journals the domain action and dispatches its typed intent
through Actions/Apply. Installation acknowledges authorization, not started or
completed work. Each order carries assignment/Method identity, an expected and
new revision, exact pawn, and a bounded list of authorized steps. The surrounding
Apply identity and existing authority generation scope the batch. Native validates
all orders before replacing any entry. A repeated identical installed revision
is a no-op; a conflicting/stale revision is refused. Release uses the same path.

The initial step families are exact thing-target work (Clean, Repair, Harvest and BeatFire through a named native WorkGiver), selected food/count,
selected bed/rest, selected horseshoes recreation, and Hold. Unsupported families are refused, not sent to a
native economic selector. Other recreation and cell-target adapters remain outside this
initial execution slice. Firefighting is an explicit policy-selected emergency revision, not an automatic native fallback. Work givers use forced:false, required capacities,
capabilities, native target checks and native reservations. They may still perform
the normal internal mechanics of their chosen job; this does not model every toil
as a separate economic decision.

For owned pawns the normal and constant think-tree selection paths are intercepted.
Override probes cannot consume/restart assignments. Opportunistic prefixes and
optional finalizer jobs are suppressed; the underlying driver's cleanup and
reservation handling still run. Existing queued/player-forced work refuses initial
acquisition instead of being erased. Native work priorities and timetables do not
select activities inside this boundary. Uncontrolled pawns keep native behavior.

A selected native Job is identified by both reference and load ID, so pooling
cannot transfer ownership. Actual StartJob and EndCurrentJob hooks distinguish an
offer from execution. Native reservation failures terminate the attempt visibly.
Successful work advances only to an explicitly authorized next step; failed or
interrupted work never silently restarts. A new revision is required to retry.
The longer-lived Method can survive interruption and submit a new attempt.

GovernorWait has no opportunistic prefix or player-forced flag. Absolute game-tick
deadlines never reset when revisited. The first dependency adapter holds on an
exact known filth reference: its destruction makes the authorized continuation
eligible; a missing/unspawned dependency is not guessed complete. More complex
dependencies require policy revisions. A deadline without release fails visibly.
Sleep and recreation are bounded by their deadlines and may finish earlier through native recovery.
Work deadline exhaustion is a failure. Native food/rest levels and physiological
consequences are not modified by execution.

Completion/failure stops the current clock window through the existing requested
pause journal path, exposing typed readback for replanning. Without another
assignment, an owned pawn waits and the game pauses rather than reverting to
vanilla choices. Downing, mental state or drafting encountered at selection/start
pauses and releases this voluntary-work owner; native involuntary behavior and
the existing combat owner are not replaced. This is not a complete autonomous
emergency-response policy; full-control production cutover requires that coverage.

Authority generation changes, game changes and despawn invalidate the transient
table and end matching owned jobs without clearing unrelated jobs. Assignments
are not saved. A restored native job has no restored planner authorization;
normal authority and current facts must authorize new control after load.

## Observation and tests

Pawn observations expose `ActivityExecution` (assignment, Method, revision, step,
state, reason, current native job ID and tick). `pawn_activity_execution` records
execution changes in the existing OTLP ring. `pawn_activity_interval` includes
known assignment/Method attribution; neither job success nor installation is
physical output evidence. No additional durable history is created.

`control/pawn-activities` uses a prepared hungry/tired producer and helper to
verify cleaning dependency, harvest, selected meal and selected bed, probe
idempotency, stale revisions and real save/load invalidation. `control/pawn-activity-lifecycle` covers atomic refusal, deadline expiry, native work refusal, selected recreation, explicit firefighting preemption and player takeover. Pure tests round-trip the
Hands action through the session codec and intent builder and reject malformed
batches. Existing `clean/bench` and `clean/care` cases remain: their helpers are
still used outside explicit ownership. #3128 deletes/replaces those policies and
cases with their economic replacements. The activity observation case remains
independent native lifecycle/output coverage.
