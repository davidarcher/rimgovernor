# Spatial contracts

[Documentation](../README.md)

These rules constrain shared plan admission and each later dispatch. They use native
observations; they do not reserve permanent ownership of coordinates.

## Shared admission

Shared spatial validation rejects overlapping planned room bounds, growing zones inside
planned rooms, and building footprints across reserved walkways or a room's doorway and
immediate inside/outside approaches. Indoor stockpiles remain allowed. Changing
construction, zones or walkways refreshes native footprints for the live plan, including
retained buildings; unavailable geometry refuses admission. Hands rechecks the current
placement's footprint before writing. These constraints protect accepted planned space;
they do not establish native reachability, arbitrary room connectivity, future expansion
rights or access throughout pawn construction.

## Native zone and doorway checks

New room shells also inspect the complete native zone census, rejecting enclosed farms
even when their cells do not touch the perimeter. Indoor stockpiles remain allowed;
perimeter overlap, unknown zone kinds and incomplete or conflicting zone geometry block
construction. Exact three-cell native reads require walkable, passable, unfogged
approaches immediately inside and outside the doorway. Hands refreshes these checks for
every unissued shell placement, preserving existing receipts on refusal. These reads do
not predict future blueprint obstruction or prove a route to colonists, and native input
is not atomic with Python validation.

## Bounded connectivity

Shell admission and each dispatch batch also scan the interior and a three-cell exterior
margin, clipping to observed map bounds and splitting detailed reads into at most 1024
cells each. Four-neighbor traversal requires usable interior cells to connect to the
inside approach, and the outside approach to reach the edge of that local margin without
crossing the proposed shell or another planned shell's walls. Unknown interior geometry
refuses construction; exterior unknowns cannot establish a route. Map edges do not count
as exits. This is local topology validation, not native pawn reachability or a forecast
of arbitrary future building obstructions. Changing the planned shells revalidates
retained shells too, so expansion cannot silently seal the only observed local exit of
an already completed tracked room.

## Zone and facing postconditions

New zone project targets retain expected patches, kind and crop. Fresh complete native
list/grid geometry must still match before the action can satisfy dependent work. New
building targets also retain expected facing for blueprints, frames and completed
buildings. Native edits invalidate completion; unavailable observations hold execution
and can recover through reads without replay. Legacy targets lacking these expectations
retain their earlier contracts. Facing currently uses native cardinal labels;
unrecognized localized labels remain unavailable.
